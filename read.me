refactor the website to a polished, professional single-page B2B website for Spanex Sciences' food preservation technology. Maintain existing content, React components and animations while implementing consistent design standards, improved code organization, and B2B-focused enhancements.

Navbar/Header (PRESERVE AS IS)

Keep the existing transforming navbar functionality that:

Appears semi-transparent over the hero section
Transforms when scrolling down (becomes more compact/opaque)
Maintains all current interactive behaviors and animations


Retain all existing styling, transitions, and responsive behaviors
Preserve the current menu button and mobile menu implementation
Do not change any aspects of the navbar appearance or functionality


Code Structure & Organization

File Naming Consistency
    Standardize all component files to .jsx extension
    Follow consistent naming patterns (PascalCase for components)
    Organize components by feature, not by type


CSS Management
    Implement CSS modules approach for component-specific styles
    Create a centralized design token system in a single variables file
    Remove duplicate style definitions across files

Component Hierarchy
    Consolidate navbar components into a single, flexible component
    Create proper component composition with clear parent-child relationships
    Implement a shared layout wrapper for consistent page structure


Design System Implementation

Typography System

Implement the following font hierarchy:
    Headings: Montserrat Bold (700)
    Subheadings: Montserrat Medium (500)
    Body: Montserrat Regular (400)


Define specific font sizes for different heading levels (h1-h6)
Ensure consistent line-heights across all text elements


Color System

Primary: #2d5500 (Dark Green) - Brand color
Secondary: #87643e (Brown) - Supporting color
Accent: #ff6e4e (Coral/Orange) - Call-to-action elements
Neutral: #f8f8f5 (Alabaster) - Backgrounds
Text: #222222 (Near Black) - Primary text
Text Secondary: #666666 (Dark Gray) - Secondary text


Spacing System

Use 8-point grid system (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
Consistent padding/margin throughout components
Standardize section spacing for visual rhythm


Component Design Standards

Cards: Consistent corner radius (8px), shadow, and padding
Buttons: Unified styling, sizes, and states
Inputs: Standardized form element styling
Icons: Consistent size and color treatment



Responsive Framework

Breakpoint System

Extra Small: < 576px (Mobile)
Small: 576px - 767px (Mobile Landscape)
Medium: 768px - 991px (Tablet)
Large: 992px - 1199px (Desktop)
Extra Large: â‰¥ 1200px (Large Desktop)


Container Widths

Fixed max-width of 1200px with proper padding
Fluid containers for full-width sections


Grid System

Implement 12-column grid for layout consistency
Use CSS Grid or Flexbox consistently
